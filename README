This repository contains my Eclipse settings.  I used the excellent 
Workspace Mechanic to save these settings so I can syncronise my settings
across different computers.

In general, I've tried to configure Eclipse to be as unobtrusive as possible.
I've turned off almost all autocompletion (I prefer autocompletion to only
offer suggestions when I explicitly ask for suggestions using ALT+/ ).  Key
bindings are Emacs-like.

key_prefs.epf was created by going to 
File > Export > General > Preferences > Keys Preferences

INSTALLATION
============

cd ~/.eclipse/
git clone git@github.com:JackKelly/mechanic.git

This should result in a directory called ~/.eclipse/mechanic/
with all the .epf files.  You'll also need to import the
eclipse_keybindings.csv file.
