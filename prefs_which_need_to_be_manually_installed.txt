PyDev -> Interpreter - Python -> Forced Builtins -> add "gi"  (this will enable autocompletion for GTK3 stuff)

PyDev -> Interpreter - Python -> Libraries -> New Folder -> /usr/local.lib/python2.7/dist-pacakges/pands-0.8.0-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg
(it may be a good idea to add many of the folders found with the following simply python script:

import sys
print sys.path
)
